Learning experiment with Axum.

## Why `Shva`?

`Shva` is the hebrew pronounciation of the name `שבא`, Sheba, as in "Queen of Sheba", related to "Aksum" or "Axum".
The Hebrew word "שווא" (also pronounced `Shva`) is a collection of grammatical phonemena, which is spelled - when leaving out the diacritics - the same as the word "שווא" (pronounced approx. `Shav`), meaning "fruitless, in vain".
Though not entirely fruitless, since learning in itself is never a wasted effort!
